# KPI Calculation Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

Based on the debug panel output, the following issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Date Format Issues**: The dashboard was having trouble parsing dates in the format DD/MM/YYYY, causing KPI calculations to fail because rows were being filtered out by date.

2. **Field Name Variations**: The KPI calculation was looking for specific field names but the actual data had different variations or capitalizations.

3. **Sheet Key Normalization**: The lookup algorithm for finding sheets was not normalized enough, causing "Missing critical sheets" errors even when the sheets were present.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Date Handling

- Improved date parsing to handle both DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY formats
- Added additional date format fixing in `yieldsDateFix.js` to ensure dates are recognized
- Made the date filtering more robust to handle different date formats

### 2. Expanded Field Name Detection

- Added more comprehensive field name candidates for "Nombre de lev√©es" to catch all variations
- Added debug logging to see which fields are found and which values are used

### 3. Improved Sheet Key Normalization

- Enhanced the `_normalizeKey` method to be more aggressive in normalization
- Added more sheet name variations to the canonical sheet names list
- Added detailed logging of available sheets and normalized keys

### 4. Added Comprehensive Debug Tools

- Added the debug panel to show sheet data and KPI calculations
- Created a `yieldsDateFix.js` script to fix date formats automatically
- Added extensive console logging to track the KPI calculation process

## How to Test

1. Open the dashboard in your browser
2. Check the debug panel by clicking the üîç button
3. Verify that the KPI values are no longer showing as 0
4. Check the console logs for detailed information about the KPI calculation process

## Additional Notes

If issues persist, you can use the debug tools to:

1. Check if all sheets are properly loaded
2. Verify that date formats are correctly recognized
3. Check if the correct field names are being found
4. Ensure that KPI calculation is working with the filtered data
