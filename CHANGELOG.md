## PROCASSEF Dashboard Fixes and Enhancements

### 1. Implemented Debug Panel
- Added a new `debugPanel.js` file with diagnostic tools
- Integrated it with the main dashboard via a button in the UI
- Shows sheet data, row counts, and KPI calculations
- Helps diagnose issues with missing or misnamed sheets

### 2. Improved Sheet Fetching and Error Handling
- Reduced API error noise by limiting repeated error messages
- Added better error detection and helpful diagnostics
- Made sheet name lookup more tolerant of case variations and naming differences

### 3. Fixed KPI Calculation Issues
- Ensured KPI calculation always uses the complete dataset (not filtered)
- Added detailed diagnostic logging when "No live data" is detected
- Made sheet detection more robust with case-insensitive lookups

### 4. Enhanced Chart Service
- Made chartService use the improved dataAggregationService for all calculations
- Added case-insensitive sheet lookups to handle different naming conventions
- Added a helper method `findSheet()` to locate sheets reliably

### 5. Better Integration Between Components
- Ensured debug panel updates when data refreshes
- Added diagnostic logging to show which sheets are found and used
- Made dashboard components more resilient to naming variations

### Testing Instructions
1. Open the dashboard in your browser
2. Click the üîç icon next to the timestamp to view the debug panel
3. Check the available sheets and their row counts
4. Try switching tabs and filtering data to ensure KPIs remain consistent
