# Enhanced Google Sheets Service - CSV-Only Mode

## Changes Made

The `EnhancedGoogleSheetsService` class has been modified to completely remove the Google Sheets API-based fetching method, now relying exclusively on the CSV export approach using sheet GIDs. This simplifies the service and eliminates potential API key issues.

### Key Changes:

1. **Removed Sheets API Logic**: 
   - Removed all code related to fetching sheets via the Google Sheets API
   - Deleted API key handling and related error handling

2. **Enforced CSV-Only Approach**:
   - Modified methods to explicitly remove any API key parameters
   - Updated the options handling to ensure only CSV fetching is used

3. **Updated Configuration**:
   - Simplified `getPROCASSEFConfig()` method by removing API key logic
   - Modified error handling and fallback cases for consistency

## Benefits

- **Simplified Code**: No more dual fetch strategies to maintain
- **Reduced Dependencies**: No reliance on API keys or Google Sheets API
- **Consistent Behavior**: Single data source for all sheets
- **Fewer Error Cases**: Eliminated API-related error conditions

## Usage

The service usage remains the same, but now all sheet fetching will use the CSV export method:

```javascript
// Example
const spreadsheetId = '1CbDBJtoWWPRjEH4DOSlv4jjnJ2G-1MvW';
const sheets = [
  { gid: '0', name: 'Sheet1' },
  { gid: '123456789', name: 'Sheet2' }
];

const data = await enhancedGoogleSheetsService.fetchMultipleSheets(spreadsheetId, sheets);
```

## Notes

- The CSV export endpoint (`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/export?format=csv&gid=SHEET_GID`) has limitations on request rate and data size, but doesn't require API keys.
- For private spreadsheets, users must still be signed in to Google and have access permissions.
- The GID for each sheet can be found in the URL when viewing the sheet in a browser.
