# Removed Files Summary

## Files Moved to Backup

The following files were moved from the main project directory to the `unused_files_backup` folder:

1. `js/dashboard.js` - Legacy dashboard implementation replaced by the enhanced version.
2. `js/liquidProgress.js` - Old progress indicator library replaced by tube progress indicators.
3. `js/googleSheetsService.js` - Original Google Sheets service replaced by the enhanced version.

## Why These Files Were Removed

These files were part of the legacy dashboard implementation. We've consolidated to use only the enhanced dashboard implementation for:

1. Better code organization
2. Improved performance
3. Enhanced user interface (tube progress indicators)
4. Elimination of duplicate initialization issues
5. Streamlined code maintenance

## If You Need These Files

If you need to reference or restore these files, they are available in the `unused_files_backup` folder. However, note that integrating them back into the project may require additional code changes since we've updated the application to use only the enhanced versions.

## Dependencies Updated

References to these files were removed from `index.html` to ensure they aren't loaded unnecessarily.
